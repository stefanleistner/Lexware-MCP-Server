  // It costs ~23ms of blocking CPU per request (53 tools at the read+drafts tier), which
  // is most of the server's own time. That tier has 39 tools since the per-type get-<type>
  // and render-<type>-pdf tools were folded into get-document and get-document-file, so
  // read the figures below as an upper bound. Measured over HTTP against the built image:
  //
  //   /status        2.1ms      <- no registration
  //   initialize    29.5ms      <- pays for all 53 tool schemas and uses none of them
  //   tools/list    41.3ms
  //
  // Do NOT take Skybridge's own boot warning ("The Skybridge handler took 68ms — it runs
  // on every request") as the recurring figure. It prints once, from the cold first build
  // during `ready()`, so it carries the JIT warm-up: steady state is ~2.5x cheaper than
  // that line suggests. Cheaper, and still the dominant cost of a request.
  //
  // Where it goes, measured by running the real registerTools twice against a server whose
  // registerTool drops `inputSchema` in one pass and keeps it in the other:
  //
  //   registration, as it runs today            22.9ms
  //   the same, minus the SDK's zod -> JSON     4.7ms   <- all the rest is ours
  //   Schema conversion
  //
  // So ~79% is `_createRegisteredTool` calling `standardSchemaToJsonSchema` on every
  // registration, and that part cannot be hoisted away from here:
  //
  //   - zod does NOT memoize `~standard.jsonSchema.input()`. Converting ONE hoisted
  //     instance 300 times costs a median 0.84ms every time and returns a fresh object on
  //     each call; a per-registration `z.object(shape)` costs 1.03ms. Hoisting buys 18%,
  //     not the ~100% a memo would.
  //   - skybridge's `registerTool` constrains its input to `Record<string,
  //     StandardSchemaWithJSON>` — a raw field shape. A pre-built schema carrying a cached
  //     JSON Schema is a compile error ("Index signature for type 'string' is missing"),
  //     and forcing it through types every handler argument `unknown`.
  //   - the server genuinely has to be per-request, so `setup` cannot hold a warmed-up
  //     one: skybridge builds a fresh instance deliberately, because sharing one would
  //     pin concurrent callers to a single negotiated protocol version.
  //
  // The remaining 4.7ms is ours and is hoistable, at the price of lifting every
  // `inputSchema` literal in src/tools/ to module scope. Not taken: a fifth of a cost
  // whose other four fifths are upstream.
  //
  // Registration still fails at BOOT, not per request, even though it lives here now:
  // `run()` awaits `ready()`, which builds one sample server (it needs the per-tool
  // security schemes to wire OAuth) before the port is bound. So a duplicate tool name or
  // a schema the SDK refuses to convert aborts module evaluation exactly as it did when
  // this ran at module scope, instead of leaving a revision that answers /status with 200
  // and every /mcp call with a 500. That ordering is undocumented, so a test pins it:
  // tests/server-boot-registration.test.ts.
